1. Run adapt_sorted_before_cellreg.m from data folder first to create a file
called sorted.m, which will contain ROI maps usable by cell reg. 
2. Then run sara_reshape.m, specifying the data folders of the sessions you
 want to align. This will save "spatial footprints", which you will need to
run cell reg.
3. Then, run CellReg.m. Make sure to closely follow the instructions in the
GUI. DO NOT CLICK TOO MUCH. Do not try to close the warning messages. Don't
press ok. The GUI is not stable. This will save cell_registered_struct.mat 
in the location you choose, which will contain the identities of overlapping
neurons
