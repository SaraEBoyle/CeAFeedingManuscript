# Photometry Analysis 
Used for free-moving feeding and liquid experiments in Extended Figure 1. Some feeding experiments used the FED3 device, developed in the Kravitz Lab, to dispense food pellets (https://open-ephys.org/fed3/fed3).

All photometry experiments used the photometry system bought from Neurophotometrics, using original software written by Sara Boyle for bleaching correction, syncronizing stimuli, and statistical analysis.
